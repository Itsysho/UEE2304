# Stack Backtrack

**One of the applications of a stack is to backtrackâ€”that is, to retrace its steps. As an example, imagine we want to read a list of items, and each time we read a negative number we must backtrack and print the five numbers that come before the negative number and then discard the neg- ative number.
Use a stack to solve this problem. Read the numbers and push them into the stack (without printing them) until a negative number is read. At this time, stop reading and pop five items from the stack and print them. If there are fewer than five items in the stack, print an error message and stop the program.
After printing the five items, resume reading data and placing them in the stack. When the end of the file is detected, print a message and the items remaining in the stack.**

Test your program with the following data:

1 2 3 4 5 -1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 -2 11 12 -3 1 2 3 4 5
